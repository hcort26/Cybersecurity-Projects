# Visualization Analysis

This project visualizes Linux and Windows OS security vulnerabilities over time using Pythonâ€™s Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The visualizations are based on inventory and vulnerability data sourced from a CSV file.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- `vulns.csv`: Contains inventory and vulnerability data for Linux and Windows systems.
- `visualization_analysis.py` or `visualization_notebook.ipynb`: Python script or notebook used to load data, generate plots, and display results.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Data Handling**: Reads and processes CSV data using Pandas.
- **Visualization**: Creates line plots showing trends in inventory and vulnerabilities over multiple months.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Displays side-by-side vulnerability trends for Linux and Windows OS.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Labels, legends, and titles included for clarity.

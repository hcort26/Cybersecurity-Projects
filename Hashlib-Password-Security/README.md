# Hashlib Password Security

This project demonstrates the use of Python's `hashlib` library to securely store user account information. It reads usernames and passwords from an input file, applies a simple salting method, hashes the passwords using SHA-256, and writes the output to a secure file.

## 📂 Project Files
- `accounts.txt`: Input file containing lines with username and password pairs (format: `username password`).
- `secure_accounts.txt`: Output file containing usernames and hashed passwords.
- `hash_passwords.py`: Python script that processes the input file, hashes the passwords with salts, and writes the output.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Password Hashing**: Uses SHA-256 to securely hash passwords.
- **Salting**: Reverses the username to create a unique salt for each password.
- **File Processing**: Reads and writes user credentials from text files.
- **Error Handling**: Skips malformed lines that don't contain both username and password.

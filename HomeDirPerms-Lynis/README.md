# Home Directory Permissions Checker

This project includes two Bash scripts designed to check and optionally fix insecure permissions on user home directories. Itâ€™s aimed at enhancing system security by ensuring that only the directory owner can access its contents.

- `check_home_dir_perms.sh`: Scans home directories and reports insecure permissions.
- `fix_home_dir_perms.sh`: Scans home directories, lists vulnerable ones, and offers the option to fix them.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Permission Scanning**: Checks permissions on `/Users/*` directories to identify insecure settings.
- **Owner Identification**: Reports the owner of each directory for additional insight.
- **Fix Option**: Provides an option to automatically apply secure permissions (`chmod 700`) to vulnerable directories.
- **Cross-Compatibility**: Designed for macOS systems using `stat -f "%Sp"` and `stat -f "%Su"`.

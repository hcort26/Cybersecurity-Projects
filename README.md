# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of cybersecurity projects. This repository consolidates a variety of security-focused projects, demonstrating skills in penetration testing, secure coding, system hardening, network scanning, password security, and data visualization.

## 📂 Project List

### 🔐 `CSC340_Project1`
A client-server Java application demonstrating secure file transfer and analysis. The server sends a text file over TCP to multiple clients, and clients save and analyze the received file using a word count utility.

### 🔐 `CSC340_Project2`
A networked trivia game system implemented in Java. The server manages trivia questions, scoring, and client connections, while clients interact via a GUI. Features include TCP and UDP communication, polling mechanisms, and point tracking.

### 🔒 `PWDChecker`
A Python script that checks password strength against common criteria and verifies whether the password exists in a known list of compromised passwords.

### 🔒 `HomeDirPerms-Lynis`
Two Bash scripts designed to assess and optionally fix insecure permissions on user home directories. Helps enforce proper file access restrictions.

### 🔒 `Port-Scanner`
A Python-based port scanner that scans all TCP ports (1-65535) on a target host and attempts to identify the services running on open ports.

### 🔑 `Hashlib-Password-Security`
A Python script that reads username-password pairs, applies a simple salting technique, hashes passwords using SHA-256, and writes the output to a secure file.

### 🏥 `StamfordHealth-Pentest`
A simulated penetration test engagement for Stamford Health. Includes documentation such as Rules of Engagement, Executive Summary, and a detailed report outlining vulnerabilities, methodologies, and remediation steps.

### 📊 `Visualization-Analysis`
A data visualization project in Python using Pandas and Matplotlib to display trends in Linux and Windows system vulnerabilities over time based on inventory data.

### 🖥️ `MicrosoftGUI_Project`
A GUI-based Java project demonstrating security-related functionalities within a user-friendly interface, incorporating secure coding and design concepts.

### 🛡️ `NWP2_Project`
A comprehensive multiplayer trivia game system built in Java. Incorporates concurrency, TCP/UDP networking, GUI design with Java Swing, and quiz logic. Includes question polling, answer evaluation, and score tracking.
